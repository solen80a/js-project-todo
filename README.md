# Todo

Netlify: https://todo-myday.netlify.app/

This is a simple and clean Todo app I built using Zustand to manage the state. You can add tasks, see all your tasks in a list, mark them as done or not done, and delete them if needed. The app also keeps track of how many tasks you have, and you can choose to show all tasks or just the ones that aren’t completed yet.

It works well on all screen sizes, from phones to large desktop screens, and includes both a light and dark mode that you can switch between. I’ve also made sure it handles empty states nicely — so it still looks good even when you don’t have any tasks yet.

Accessibility was important in this project too, so it follows best practices to make sure it’s usable for everyone. It’s a great example of how to build a small, useful app with modern tools and clean code.
