[x] Understand the concept of global state vs. prop drilling
[x] Fork and clone the provided repository
[x] Attend/prepare for Tuesday’s live session

Planning Tasks
[] Sketch app UI and layout
[] Break UI into reusable components
[] Define the data structure for a task (e.g., id, text, isCompleted, createdAt, dueDate, category, etc.)
[] Design the structure of the Zustand store

Core Development Tasks
[] Set up Zustand store
[] Create global state with task list
[] Define actions: addTask, removeTask, toggleTaskCompletion
[] Build base components
[] Task List
[] Task Item
[] Add Task Form
[] Task Counter
[] Implement core features
[] Add new tasks
[] Display all tasks (completed and uncompleted)
[] Toggle task completion status
[] Remove tasks
[] Show count of tasks (total or uncompleted)

UI/UX Tasks
[] Style the app (clean and simple design)
[] Implement empty states design
[] Make the app responsive (320px to 1600px)

Accessibility & Performance
[] Ensure all images have alt attributes
[] Check color contrast for accessibility
[] Achieve ≥ 95 score on Lighthouse audit
[] Follow clean code best practices

Stretch Goals (Optional but Recommended)
[] Add task creation timestamps
[] Format and display timestamps (use date-fns or Moment.js)
[] Add "Complete All" button
[] Implement dark/light mode toggle !!See the Thuesday practice starter-code!!
[] Use localStorage for persistence
[] Add due date input for tasks
[] Display due date
[] Highlight overdue tasks
[] Add filters (e.g., completed/uncompleted, by date)
[] Implement task categories or tags
[] Create and manage project groups of tasks
[] Mark project as complete when all tasks are done

Development Tips
[] Start small: begin with hardcoded task list and toggle functionality
[] Gradually add complexity: build up to dynamic task addition/removal
[] Test your store logic separately before UI integration
[] Commit often, test early
